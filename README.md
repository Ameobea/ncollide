ncollide  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sebcrozet/ncollide.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sebcrozet/ncollide)
========

**ncollide** is a n-dimensional collision detection library written with the
rust programming language.

As its name suggests, it is generic wrt the dimension: it works with both
2-dimensional and 3-dimensional geometries.  It might work with higher
dimensions (never tried).


## Compilation
You will need the last rust compiler from the master branch.
If you encounter problems, make sure you have the last version before creating an issue.

The simplest way to build **ncollide** and all its dependencies is to do a
recursive clone:


    git clone --recursive git://github.com/sebcrozet/ncollide.git
    cd ncollide
    make deps
    make

## Features
- dynamic bounding volume tree based broad phase
- ball vs. ball collision detection,
- plane vs. any convex object collision detection.
- collision detection between arbitrary convex objects
- compound geometries
- ray-casting
- time of impact computation  for objects without rotational movement (compound vs. compound is not
  yet implemented)

And various traits for collision detectors and broad phase collision detection.

## What is missing
Some common features are still missing:

- heightmaps
