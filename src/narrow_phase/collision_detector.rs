/// collision, it must be able to compute the exact contact point(s), normal and penetration depth
/// in order to give enough informations to the constraint solver.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `G1`- the type of the first object involved on the collision detection.
/// * `G2`- the type of the second object involved on the collision detection.

    /// collision detector (the same structure) is always used with the same
    /// pair of object.
