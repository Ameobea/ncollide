/**
 * Trait of the algorithms executed during the so-called Narrow Phase.
 *
 * The goal of the narrow phase is to determine exactly if two objects collide. If there is
 * collision, it must be able to comptute the exact contact point(s), normal and penetration depth
 * in order to give enough informations to the constraint solver.
 *
 * # Arguments
 * * `N` - the type of the penetration depth.
 * * `V` - the type of the contact normal and contact points.
 * * `G1`- the type of the first object involved on the collision detection.
 * * `G2`- the type of the second object involved on the collision detection.
